# Cyclist_Safety_NYC
Are cyclists in NYC safer today then 5 years ago?
Analysed NYC DOT accident data, containing 1,500,000 accident records. 
Researched three topics:
- are cyclists on the NYC streets safer today then 5 years ago
- what is most likely to cause an accident?
- what are the most dangerous areas of the city, and what are the most dangerous hours for cyclists and pedestrians?
